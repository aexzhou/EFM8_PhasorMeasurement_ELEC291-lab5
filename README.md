# UBC ELEC 291 Lab 5: Phasor Measurement
### Description
- The main file to run is `EFM8_ADC.c`. This can be automatically done by using the `Makefile`: `lab5.mk`.
- `stripchart_sinewave.py` is a simple Python program written to display the phasor data collected via the serial port. This was a bonus extra feature we included in this lab.
